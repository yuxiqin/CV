## Research and Publications
### Research:
Human gesture recognition based on WiFi signals: Human gestures will interfere with WiFi signals, and different gestures will bring different effects. We use fine-grained Channel State Information (CSI) extracted from WiFi signals to recognize different gestures. The raw CSI contains a lot of noise and redundant information, so we need to pre-process it: noise reduction, scale transformation and feature extraction.   Finally, the machine learning algorithms are used to recognize the acquired features.

## Major Courses and Skills
Major courses    Pattern recognition, Machine learning, Advanced Mathematics, Linear algebra, Probability theory, Computer Networks, Principles of Computer Composition.
### Programming    
For languages: Proficient in C# and Python. Learned Java, JavaScript, SQL, C, C++ and PHP. 

For projects: Used C# to complete the test software of driving school (desktop), teaching program used by school administration department (website), many crawler programs and so on. Used Python for testing Machine Learning algorithms in my research field. For Java and Android, I learned the basic development process and tried to make a simple ticket information App, and I know nothing about IOS. For JavaScript, Extjs and Jquery are the most familiar UI for me, and I've done some web pages used these tools. For SQL, I worked with most relational databases, including SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, and SQLite.
